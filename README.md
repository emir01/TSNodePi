# TSNodePi
Typescript Node Raspberry Pi Experiment

## Running A Module

You can use `npm start` to compile and run the main typescript file. There are 2 modules in src/sense that do different things with the LED on the sense.

## Issue with running without a Sense Hat

If you try to run without a Sense hat the build will fail because of the imported sense-hat-led module.
